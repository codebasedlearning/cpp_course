# Unit 0x02

## Tasks

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'Baker River'

- Write a function `cut` that sets the decimal places to 0 for two `double` numbers passed by reference. Use the `floor`
  function from `cmath`.
- Write a function `rotate` that exchanges three strings passed by reference in sequence, meaning the first string gets
  the content of the second, the second gets the content of the third, and the third gets the content of the first.

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'Sanborn Cliff'

Array:

- Create an array of length 3 of type 'double' and initialize the first two elements with values 1.0 and 2.0.
- Store the sum in the third element.
- Output all elements.
- Create another array of the same size and copy the first array into the second array.
- Output the new array.

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'Elkford'

Example structure `polynom`:

- Define a global variable `dim` with value 3.
- Define a structure `polynom` that contains a field of size `dim` of coefficients `coeffs`.
- Program a global function `eval` to evaluate a polynomial `p` at a position `x`.
  Pass the polynomial ('call-by-ref') and the position to the function.
- Write meaningful test code.

Extension:

- Implement an operator `<<` for output (Look it up).

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'Harshire'

Example structure `stack`:

- Learn how a 'Stack' works (Wikipedia).
- Define a structure `stack` that contains a fixed-length array (e.g. 3) of `int` and
  a variable `next` for the next free position in the array.
- Implement functions `pop` and `push` that retrieve data from or add data to the stack (if there is space).
- Write meaningful test code.

Extension:

- Throw a custom exception when the stack is full.

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'AI'

What would the AI say about it?

Pick your solutions and ask a GenAI-Tool of your choice (e.g., ChatGPT) for its opinion.
- What improvements are suggested?
- Do they make sense?

<hr>

### 👉 Task 'Couch Potato' - Recurring homework.

- If you have not completed the main tasks in the exercise, complete them at home.
- Study `study_auto`, `study_stoi_stod` and `study_trailingreturn`.

<hr>

### 👉 Comprehension Check

- I have understood all codes and exercise topics.
- I know what a reference is.
- I know the difference between 'call-by-value' and 'call-by-ref'.
- I can throw and catch exceptions.
- I can use `auto`.
- I know an array.
